                explain: "you can ask to face one single and specific instance of the problem (or to download it, or to see what would be a correct answer for it). To do so, use this argument to select its source (whether a random generator or an archive of hardcoded instances). For instances from an archive you must also specify the <instanceID> argument (progressive numbers starting from 1). For those produced by a random generator you need to specify the random <seed> and the other arguments as required by that specific generator. The generator `rand_gen` reconstructs an instance from its instance descriptor <n_min,n_max,seed>."
            instanceID:
                regex: ^([1-9][0-9]{0,2})$
                default: 1
                explain: specify the number of the hardcoded instance in the archive selected via argument <one_instance_source>.
            seed:
                regex: ^(random|[1-9][0-9]{5,5})$
                default: random
                explain: to require a specific random instance select its random generator in the <one_instance_source> argument and its numeric code in <seed>. You also need to specify the precise values for each of the other arguments comprising the instance descriptor.
            n_min:
                regex: ^(0|[1-9][0-9]{0,100})$
                default: 0
                explain: argument needed by the random instance generation process. Used to define the range [n_min, n_max] for the argument n of the function f you must implement.
            n_max:
                regex: ^(0|[1-9][0-9]{0,100})$
                default: 0
                explain: argument needed by the random instance generation process. Used to define the range [n_min, n_max] for the argument n of the function f you must implement.
